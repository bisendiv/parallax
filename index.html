        <p>Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by the Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics.[1] Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016,[2] and made its first public appearance in mid-March 2016 at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, United States.[3] Sophia is marketed as a "social robot" that can mimic social behavior and induce feelings of love in humans.[1][4]

            Sophia has been covered by media around the globe, and has participated in many high-profile interviews. In October 2017, Sophia was granted Saudi Arabian citizenship, becoming the first robot to receive legal personhood in any country.[5] In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first Innovation Champion, and is the first non-human to be given a United Nati beatae eligendi laboriosam quaerat saepe itaque aspernatur.

    <div class="para">
        <p>Sophia was first activated on Valentines Day,[9] February 14, 2016.[2] The robot, modeled after the ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti,[10] Audrey Hepburn, and its inventor's wife, Amanda Hanson,[1][11] is known for its human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. Sophia imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather).[9]

            Hanson has said that he designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes, to help crowds at large events or parks, or to serve in customer service, therapy, and educational applications,[9][12] and that he hopes that the robot can ultimately interact with other humans sufficiently to gain social skills.[13]
            
            On October 11, 2017, Sophia was introduced

        <h2>SHOPHIYA SOFTWARE</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
    <p>Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics.[25][26] According to founder David Hanson, Sophia's source code is about 70% open source.[7] A computer vision algorithm processes input from cameras within Sophia's eyes, giving Sophia visual information on its surroundings. It can follow faces, sustain eye contact, and recognize individuals. It can process speech and have conversations using a natural language subsystem.[2]

        As of 2018, Sophia's architecture includes scripting software, a chat system, and OpenCog, an AI system designed for general reasoning.[27] OpenCog Prime, primarily the work of Hanson Robotics' former chief scientist Ben Goertzel, is an architecture for robot and virtual embodied cognition that defines a set of interacting components designed to give rise to human-equivalent artificial general intelligence (AGI) as an emergent phenomenon of the whole system.[28]

        <h2>APPEARANCES AND INTERVIWES</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        <p>Sophia has appeared on CBS 60 Minutes with Charlie Rose,[38] Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan,[39] and outlets like CNBC, Forbes, Mashable, the New York Times, the Wall Street Elle.com.[41]

            Sophia has been interviewed in the same manner as a human, striking up conversations with hosts. Some replies have been nonsensical, while others have impressed interviewers such as 60 Minutes's Charlie Rose.[33]
            
            In an October 2017 interview for CNBC, when the interviewer expressed concerns about robot behavior, Sophia joked that he had "been reading too much Elon Musk. And watching too many Hollywood movies".[42] Musk tweeted that Sophia should watch The Godfather and asked "what's the worst that could happen?"[43]ience".
            
            In May 2018, photographer Giulio Di Sturco did a photo shoot of Sophia which appeared in National Geographic.[1] Wired reported on the shoot.[2]</p>
